# highcharts Scatter plot

Typescript and react implementation of a highchart scatter plot. Eventually will be combined with a heatmap to create a combination of both.

## Getting Started

Quick instructions on how to get everything running. Right now there isn't too much stuff to do.

### Installing

Install the node dependencies
```
npm install
```

Start the dev server
```
npm run start:dev
```

### Adding custom viz to Looker

In looker we are going to have to add the newly created custom viz.
* Go to Admin and click on Platform/Visualizations
* Click 'Add Visualization' button, name the ID and Label as you wish.
* In the box Main copy and paste the url from your npm dev server and save.
